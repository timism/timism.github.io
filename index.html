			Happiness, love, passion, beauty, abundance.     You are eternal and were destined to be here.     All exists.  Reaches the parts other faiths don't reach  
			The way the truth and the light  Only partly plagiarised  Bit like Buddhism  or Pastafarianism  Not as depressing as atheism  or Dawkins rattling on.  Facebook  https://www.facebook.com/Timism-111045413774190        Tweet  https://twitter.com/wayofTimism        Why theres something rather than nothing  Like 2+2=4 It all has to be. The whole damn lot.        eternal life  In our world time is kind of an illustion - there willa always be the earlier you doing your thing and all imagined versions of heaven and afterlifes exist in a way similar to our world.  cheerfulness  Depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability costing the economy about $1trn per year accoring to the WHO. Part of the problem is atheistic belief systems make it look pointless and religious ones seem made up and phoney. I'm hoping Timism can help by being both real and cheerful  peace on earth  I'm hoping that meditating on a heaven like existence will encourage people to be a bit nicer in this one and help fix our main problems.  Why something rather than nothing  Why are we here? We seem to have evolved but why is the universe here in the first place? Indeed why is there anything rather than just nothing?     I suggest the reason is mathematical truths have to be, eg five being prime – it just is – it doesn’t need a creator of anything like that.     The universe when you get down to fundemental physics is all mathematical in nature. It’s all solutions to Shrodingers equation and the like that than springs and widgets. So quite likely it’s a mathematial patten that is that way in the same way that other mathemtical patterns are such as the prime numbers or the Mandelbrot pattern, part of which is here.     Here’s an argument that if you find some equations where the solution looks like a universe with evolved life in, the life would think they exist. It assumes that consciousness is something that has come about throught evolution for practial purposes – in the struggle for survival it’s an advantage to be conscious rather than unconscious and the like.     Ok imagine you run a computer simulation of the laws on some hyperthetical super powerful computer. You’d see something like a big bang, billions of years of evolution and at some stage a conscious creature thinking what am I doing here. Presumably it has to feel like it exists to think that. However the mental state being that is part of the solutions to the equations and has always been that even without the hyperthetical computer. Hence the creature must feel it exists computer or not.     I mean it all fits, there are not other explanations. Where's my Noble price already?     on human reality  By the above argument you can suggest all possible realities exist and are as real for those within them as ours is to us, assuming they have evolved similar consciousness.     So in this way all imagined realites exist in some form so heaven, hell, your various gods and the like are all real but just in separate realities. You can’t access them physically but you can through imagination or calculation. Eg you can calculate the mandelbrot pattern or imagine heaven.     So in a way heaven is real. Also the passage of time is kind of like an illustion. From an external perspective there is always you now doing what you are doing and also a younger you doing some earlier stuff and an older. They are like that always like the prime numbers, always there.  What to do about it?  The ideas are kind of compatible with most traditional religion heaven and hell and gods exist in other realites although not in the sense of God invervining physically in this one with lightening bolts and such. In initial effects on human happiness it’s kind of a weird more than anything. However there are posibilites for making it positive and happy. I suggest focus on the good stuff. eg meditate on nothing for a while then on heaven then on this reality being something like a video game to enjoy and not take th bad bits to seriously.  timism  A new religion / philosophy a bit like Buddhism but based on the ponderings of a Tim hence Timism.     The basic idea is our universe exists a mathematical object that has to be as it is. That’s why there’s something rather than nothing – is has to be that way in the same way that five has to be prime. It just is.     The pattern that is our physical universe seems real to us because we are part of it. Other mathematical objects and possible worlds seem abstract to us because we are not part of them but would seem real to those within.     From the scientific proof point of view there is an argument below argue that it is that way.     From a lifestyle point of view, you can access other realties through your imagination and similar methods and in a way they are all real. You can meditate on being in a heaven like reality and the return to the real world as something like playing a video game. The suffering of this world just being part of the game like people being shot in virtual reality.     Hopefully this can make things more cheerful. I’m experimenting with it. It’s a bit of a work in progress.  Our Core Values  Show off your projects, features, or clients in this section.   Why this thing?  Its part of the Mandelbrot pattern  This is an infinitely complicated pattern that exists as part of mathematics, discovered by Dr Mandelbrot but it would be the same anywhere in our or any other universe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set   Is reality similar?  That's the basic theory  here's another image from Wikipedia      Another view  This is form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxrwz3fijjA While the pattern is part of math,
