<h3> Some potential upsides</h3>
<p>
The idea we are here as the result of mathematical necessity is rather odd, really neither obviously good or bad </p>
is down to 
<h3> Death is down to perspective</h3>
<p> 
</p>

<h3> Heaven is real in a way</h3>
<p> 
</p>

<h3> jesus loves you and the force is with you</h3>
<p> 
</p>

<h3> practical philosophy for this world</h3>
<p> 
</p>

<h3>An argument as to why there is</h3>
<p>
To explain why there is something rather than nothing while getting around the how did that get there issue, the only way seems to be to start from something that has to exist without needing a creator. So you can look around for things that might fit.
</p><p>
About the only things you come there are as far as I can tell are what you could call mathematical facts, things like 2+2=4 or the Mandelbrot set looking like it does. These definately have some sort of existence in that they can be discovered and looked at and say aliens in some other universe could have a look and find the same stuff. They exist by a kind of logical necessity. 
</p><p>
(When you mention this stuff people get side tracked by Plato who talked about this and speculated things like 4 exited in a realm of perfect forms with the ideal 4 in it which is a bit silly. Please just accect 2+2=4 without dragging Plato into it).
</p><p>
Anyway we have this mathematical stuff that looks like it has to be in some sense and then there is the observation that the laws of physics are a bunch of maths and the fundamental particles seem a bit more like mathematical objects rather than something solid you could take a photo of. 
</p><p>
So maybe it's all maths and that's why it's all here. The solutions exist to all possible mathematical relationships in the sense that they could be discovered, this is sufficient for it to seem real to evolved life within them and that's it really. The relationships that the life is part of would seem physical reality to them and other solutions would seem like abstract maths and visa verso to life in other solutions. 
</p><p>
You can even offer a sort of thought experiment proof that could be discovered type existence would lead to it seeming real to those within before being discovered as follows:
</p><p>
Say you have some equations looking like laws of physics and run a simulation on a hyper powerful computer to see what they would produce. You press go and see a big bang, life evolve and say some evolved life go down the pub. Persumably the descision to go down the pub would be as a result of evolved conscsiousness hence seem real to the evolvee but it would have always been thus hence there before you did the computing. 
</p><p>

As to why to belive this - it fits the observation we exist and provides an explanation for why it's all here, and there isn't any other explanation we know of hence it's probably the one.
</p>

<h3>How does this compare to Tegmarks Mathamtical universe hypotheses?</h3>
<p>Wikipedia puts it
"Tegmark's MUH is: Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure."

I'm aruging basically the same thing execpt I don't think he as the something rather than nothing stuff. 
</p>


<h3>Any point to all this?</h3>
<i>“This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.” - The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy</i>
<p>
Aside the the curiosity aspect of why are we here and maybe some insights into the laws of physics, I'm kind of hoping being able to build on a more real understanding may lead to greater happiness and all that kind of stuff.
</p>


<h3>Testable?</h3>
<p>
</p>

You can consider this as a hypothesis. Presumably it either the reason for existence or it isn't and it seems perhaps an interesting question which it is. I've had arguments that the theory is meaninless, like saying the universe came out of the back of a duck or something but that's not really true - you could use a telescope to see if there's signs of the duck and likewise with god did it theories you can have a look a the old bloke sitting on a cloud depicted on the sistine chapel and compare that with sigitngs of real coulds next time you get a window seat and figure that one is perhpas unlikely. 
.</p>



<h3>Simplicity and first principles</h3>
<p>
This stuff can get confusing so it's easiest to stick to simple things you can prove such as that prime numbers exist in that you can find them, rather than getting side tracked into what Plato may have thought about it all.
